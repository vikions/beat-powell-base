# 💼 Beat Powell

**Beat Powell** — an onchain meme-game where you can literally “punch the rate” to help the crypto market breathe again 😤💸  

Every crypto trader is secretly waiting for Jerome Powell to cut rates…  
Now you can finally **take action onchain** — one click at a time.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay

Each click represents a symbolic **“rate cut”** on the blockchain.  
The global rate decreases with every hit, and all players see it update in real time.

To make it more fun (and more crypto-realistic), each punch costs **0.1 USDC (testnet)** —  
a small “fee to fight inflation” 💥

---

## 🧠 How it works

- Built on **Base Sepolia**  
- Uses **Base Account SDK** with **Sub Accounts** and **Auto Spend Permissions**  
- Each user automatically gets a Sub Account when connecting  
- After granting “Spend Permissions,” you can click freely — without signing every transaction  
- Every press updates onchain contract state and transfers 0.1 USDC to the treasury

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- React + Vite  
- Base Account SDK (`@base-org/account`)

- Smart contract deployed on Base Sepolia

## 🧩 How to play

1. Connect your Base Account (Coinbase Smart Wallet)  
2. Approve creation of a Sub Account  
3. When prompted, allow “Spend Permissions” for USDC  
4. Hit the **"PAY 0.1 USDC & HIT POWELL"** button  
5. Watch the global interest rate fall 📉

## 💬 Idea

Crypto loves memes — but memes can move markets too.  
This game channels the collective **"Rate Cut Hopium"** into an interactive onchain ritual.  
Each player’s action symbolically pushes us one step closer to a lower rate environment —  
and maybe, just maybe, a better market 🧘‍♂️

So if you believe in the bull — **start hitting Powell.**
